```{r}
temp

```
The first thing I notice about this dataset is that it doesnt show in tabular form by simply tyoing in "temp" and running the command, whereas the "beer" command does. Why is this?

```{r}
View(temp)
```

The above command does show in more tabular form, however, the dat adoesn't include unit of measurement, or the destination in which the measurements were recorded. Is this a holiday destination, taken from another planet or a a recording of temps from a lab exeriment.a source would also be beneficial, to allow comparision of discrepancies between similar datasets.

```{r}
?temp
```

The above confirms that it is infact a matrix which contains the maximum temp for eac month in scotland from 1910 to 2015.

I believe this format to be a matrix of collected vectors, after further investigation of the previous command the vectoer format was also confirmed.. I can check this by using the following command:
```{r}
class(temp)
```
it is indeed stored as a matrix.

I can further investigate the dataset using:
```{r}
str(temp)
```
no year is attributed to the row elemnt...how do I add this?

can a calculate the averages using a loop based on name?
```{r}
names(temp)
```
 I can calculate the column sums and means usong the following:
```{r}
colSums(temp)
```
 
```{r}
colMeans(temp)
```

reduve the number of dp?
```{r}
?colMeans
```

decided to use the following to match the format data inputted to ethe calculation:
```{r}
round(colMeans(temp), digits = 1)
```
```{r}
plot(temp[1,], yrange = xlab = month.name, ylab = temp)
```
