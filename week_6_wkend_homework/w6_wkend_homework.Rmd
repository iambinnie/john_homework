```{r}
library(tidyverse)
tweets <- read.csv("code_clan_tweets.csv")
tweets
```

```{r}
dim(tweets)
names(tweets)

```

```{r}
boxplot(tweets$favorite_count)
```


Summarise the number of likes (stored in favorite_count) that CodeClan tweets have got. Donâ€™t summarise when it was a quoted tweet (is_quote variable).
```{r}
no_is_quote <- filter(tweets, is_quote != TRUE)
no_is_quote
```

Summarise the mean number of retweets (retweet_count), by the type of platform that was used to tweet (source).
```{r}
tweets_grouped_source <- group_by(no_is_quote, source)
tweets_grouped_source
```

```{r}
summarise(tweets_grouped_source, count = n())
```

Count the number of likes by media type, and arrange them from most likes to least.
```{r}
arrange(tweets_grouped_source, desc(media_type))
```
